[JsonCpp]

The JsonCpp library's source code, including accompanying documentation,
tests and demonstration applications, are licensed under the following
conditions...

Baptiste Lepilleur and The JsonCpp Authors explicitly disclaim copyright in all
jurisdictions which recognize such a disclaimer. In such jurisdictions,
this software is released into the Public Domain.

In jurisdictions which do not recognize Public Domain property (e.g. Germany as of
2010), this software is Copyright (c) 2007-2010 by Baptiste Lepilleur and
The JsonCpp Authors, and is released under the terms of the MIT License (see below).

In jurisdictions which recognize Public Domain property, the user of this
software may choose to accept it either as 1) Public Domain, 2) under the
conditions of the MIT License (see below), or 3) under the terms of dual
Public Domain/MIT License conditions described here, as they choose.

The MIT License is about as close to Public Domain as a license can get, and is
described in clear, concise terms at:

   http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MIT_License

The MIT license is compatible with both the GPL and commercial
software, affording one all of the rights of Public Domain with the
minor nuisance of being required to keep the above copyright notice
and license text in the source code. Note also that by accepting the
Public Domain "license" you can re-license your copy using whatever
license you like.
